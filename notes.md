#Notes
This is just going to be a readme file that will kind of just document what I've learned from the codeacademy class and the index.txt is the file that lists how I am using the things that I am learning.

##Comments
You can comment the code using 3 Quote marks at the beginning and at the end of the statement or you can use a hashtag

```python
  #This is the hashtag way to comment
  """This is the quotation way to comment"""
```

##Functions
You declare a function by using `def function_name(): `
To call on a function, you just do `function_name()` when ever you want to call on it
