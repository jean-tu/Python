# Python Folder

There are two folders in here: CodeAcademy and Lynda.

## CodeAcademy 
Within CodeAcademy, there are just some programs that I was learning to write when I was going through the course.

## Lynda
Within the Lynda folder there is another folder called Flask where I am learning about Flask.
Other folders may show up as I continue to learn more about them.
