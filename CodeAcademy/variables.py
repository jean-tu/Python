#This is the first lesson inside CodeAcademy, where we learn how to define variables
#The interesting thing about Python is htat you don't have to define what it is that you are going to be storing
#In the other 2 languages that I have learned (Java & C++) we would have to declare the variable
#char a = 'a'; for example, but with python you just assign it and use it!

my_variable = 10; #automatically sets my_variable to 10
my_name = "Jean Tu"; #It's cool how we don't have to declare the type
print my_name;
